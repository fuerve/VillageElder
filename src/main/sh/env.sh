# PROPERTIES SOURCE
#

# Village Elder supports loading properties from disk in a couple
# of ways.  Uncomment and modify the one that is appropriate for
# your installation.

# By default, properties will be loaded from a file on the
# class path called VillageElder.properties.  This is
# probably fine for most installations.
export VILLAGE_ELDER_PROPERTIES_SOURCE="default"

# Alternatively, you can specify an explicit pathname from which
# to load properties.
#export VILLAGE_ELDER_PROPERTIES_SOURCE="~/VillageElder.properties"
