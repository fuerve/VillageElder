Wednesday, May 1st, 2013: Added the indexing support classes.
---------------------------------------------------
Village Elder can now index source control revisions.  The interface to Lucene's Document class is clunky, in my opinion, but it's how they implemented their API so that's how I'm handling it until we decide that we need to get more flexible with the index schema.  Faceting is supported as well (and is, in fact, a requirement at this time).

Sunday, April 28th, 2013: Initial check-in
---------------------------------------------------
Contains libraries for sifting through source control logs, with a concrete implementation for Subversion.
